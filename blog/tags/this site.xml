            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are <strong>terribly pleased with ourselves</strong> as we announce the launch of this site! It's almost embarassing. It makes us feel like going out for a long lunch that includes a little day drinking. After all, moments like this don't come along very often.</p>

<p>I'd like to thank everyone here at our imaginary company for their hard work and dedication. People have sacrificed almost an hour (or so) of their personal lives for this, so I hope you appreciate it.</p>

<p>I'd also like to thank the people who built <a href="https://sculpin.io/">the Sculpin static site generator</a>. Without them, we wouldn't have been able to stand this thing up in such a short time, and with so little effort.</p>

<p>Now that you've found us, don't be a stranger. Check back for strange, new content from our imaginary team of talented writers. And remember that all of your dreams are <strong>only a blog away</strong>.</p>

<p>With kind regards,</p>

<p><em>The Editor</em></p>
